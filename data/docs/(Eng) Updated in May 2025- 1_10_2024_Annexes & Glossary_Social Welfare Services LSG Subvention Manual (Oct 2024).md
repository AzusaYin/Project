<span id="page-3-0"></span>Notes:

1. Funding received from sources other than the Social Welfare Department (SWD) or those listed on [SWD's website](https://www.swd.gov.hk/storage/asset/section/585/en/List%20of%20funds%20or%20subsidy%20schemes%20exempt%20from%20cost-apportionment.pdf) under funds or subsidy schemes from government bureaux/departments for FSA services / FSA-related activities should be properly recorded under Note 5(c) "Other Funds or Donations for Designated Purposes" to the AFR. All relevant supporting documents must be available for inspection by authorised staff of SWD and audit by the Audit Commission.

2. The relevant amount should be properly supported and included under Note 5(a) "Programme Income" to the AFR.

3. NGOs should be responsible for the utilisation of the other funding received for designated purposes for FSA services / FSA-related activities. As the amount aims to reflect the actual cash expenditure, the cost apportionment of Lump Sum Grant resources needs not be included under this column.

4. If there is any unspent balance out of the non-SWD funded FSA services / FSA-related activities that must be returned to the funder, such payment shall be borne by the NGO's own resources.

#Amounts should tally with those reported in the column of "Other Funds or Donations for Designated Purposes" in Note 8 to the AFR.

- \*1. The relevant supporting documents for calculating the % of LSG used on FSA-related activities of an ASU should be kept by the NGO and produced for SWD's inspection upon request. In deriving the % for each FSA-related activity, any surplus or deficit of the "completed" activity funded by Other Funds or Donations for Designated Purposes in the concerned year should be taken into account to reduce or increase the apportioned LSG resources respectively per formula in paragraph 3.5 of this Manual.
- 2. If cost apportionment has been made, these activities would not be counted toward the proportion of the use of LSG on FSA-activities of the ASU, but they may be reported in Part B (applicable to those FSA-related activities recommended by the NGO to be incorporated in FSA services) of this statement.
- \*\*1. If the total LSG used on FSA-related activities accounts for 10% or less of the LSG allocated by the NGO to the ASU, the NGO must ensure that these activities meet the (i)-(iv) four criteria for assessment of FSA-related activities as stipulated in paragraph 3.5 of this Manual.
- 2. If the total LSG used on FSA-related activities accounts for more than 10% of the LSG allocated by the NGO to the ASU, the NGO must ensure that these activities comply with the seven criteria (i)-(vii) for assessment of FSA-related activities as stipulated in paragraph 3.5 of this Manual.
- 3. If the total LSG used on FSA-related activities accounts for more than 20% of the LSG allocated by the NGO to the ASU, the expenditure exceeding 20% cannot be charged to LSG.

### **Provident Fund for Snapshot Staff**

- <span id="page-12-0"></span>1. Snapshot Staff refers to the staff employed by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for taking up posts in the recognised establishment of subvented service units as at 1 April 2000, prior to the implementation of Lump Sum Grant Subvention System (LSGSS).
- 2. Under the LSGSS, the Provident Fund (PF) provision for Snapshot Staff is calculated on an actual basis according to the reported rank and number of posts (including fractional posts) in the Snapshot, basing on the previous recognised level (i.e. 5% for the first 10 contributory years of service, 10% for 11 to 15 years, or 15% for 16 years or more) so as to enable NGOs to honour their contractual commitmentsin terms of PF benefitsto Snapshot Staff until they leave the NGOs.
- 3. NGOs are required to update the Snapshot Staff position in September each year with the staff departure date, and also the date of promotion / change of rank clearly indicated. PF for both Snapshot Staff and Other Posts (i.e. non-Snapshot Staff) will be paid provisionally according to the September position and projected total PF requirements as part of the monthly subvention. When the actual PF subvention is determined, the actual surplus / shortfall for Snapshot Staff as well as the additional subvention for Other Posts arising from departure of Snapshot Staff will be taken into account in determining future PF subvention. When a member of the Snapshot Staff within the recognised establishment leaves the NGO, the salary portion of the LSG (regardless of whether the LSG was originally above or below the benchmark) will remain unchanged, but the PF provision will be replaced by 6.8% of the mid-point salary of the recognised rank of that staff member in the Snapshot on 1 April 2000.
- 4. Snapshot Staff deployed to non-Funding and Service Agreement services subsidised by Social Welfare Department (SWD) or supported by grants within the control of SWD (such as experimental projects funded by Lotteries Fund, projects of Community Investment and Inclusion Fund, excluding contract residential care homes for the elderly allocated through competitive bidding) is also recognised.
- 5. PF provisions are to be disclosed in the following ways:
	- (a) the PF provisions for Snapshot Staff and Other Posts are separately identified in the LSG payment advice issued to NGOs;
	- (b) the PF of Snapshot Staff and Other Posts should be separately stated in NGOs' accounting records in respect of the PF received and PF expenditure; and

(c) a PF analysis should be included in the NGOs' Annual Financial Report showing the PF subvention received, expenditure and surplus in respect of Snapshot Staff and Other Posts.

#### Notes

- 1. The fees are recognised for the purpose of calculating subvention only.
- 2. The fee-charging scales are determined according to the service users' family household financial status with reference to the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance level and may be adjusted.
- 3. The co-payment levels are determined according to the service users' family household financial status with reference to the Median Monthly Domestic Household Income and may be adjusted.
- 4. Conversion Home Providing Continuum of Care is required to convert self-care (S/C) places and/or home for the aged (H/A) places together with the existing careand-attention (C&A) places into long term care places providing continuum of care. The conversion of S/C places has been completed in 2018. The fees for H/A places and C&A places remain applicable to service users who have not yet taken up the long term care places. H/A places are charged at \$1,481 (\$1,115 plus \$366 for rent) for single elderly persons or 50% disabled persons, \$1,559 (\$1,193 plus \$366 for

rent) for 100% disabled persons/Disability Allowance recipients. C&A places are charged at \$1,660 (\$1,294 plus \$366 for rent) for single elderly persons and 50% disabled persons and \$1,871 (\$1,505 plus \$366 for rent) for 100% disabled persons/Disability Allowance recipients.

- ## This rate is applicable to service users with family income above the MMDHI.
- ^ This rate is applicable to 50% disabled elderly persons, elderly persons receiving Old Age Allowance / Old Age Living Allowance
- ^^ This rate is applicable to 100% disabled elderly persons or elderly persons receiving Disability Allowance.
- \* This rate is applicable to 50% disabled adult or single elderly persons.
- \*\* This rate is applicable to 100% disabled adults / Disability Allowance recipients.

#### **Fee-charging Principles in respect of Subvented Welfare Services**

<span id="page-21-0"></span>Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating subvented welfare services should observe the following rules and principles in administering fees and charges –

- 1. Prior approval must be sought from the Social Welfare Department if an NGO plans to introduce new fees and charges on value-added services governed by Funding and ServiceAgreements (FSAs) for which subvention is provided.
- 2. For other fees and charges, such as programme fees and fees from other miscellaneous services incidental to the operation of subvented services, the proposed fees and charges should not bring any adverse effect on the provision or delivery of FSA activities.
- 3. The purpose of charging additional fees and charges is to meet the individual or special needs of service users, instead of providing generic services or basic facilities.
- 4. Consultation with service users and/or their family members should be made prior to introducing any new fees and charges, followed by reviews as and when appropriate.
- 5. The affordability of service users on the proposed items should be assessed before introducing any new fees and charges.
- 6. Fees should be charged on a cost-recovery basis, with a clearly defined schedule of fees and charges that is accessible by service users and/or their family members.
- 7. Service users and/or their family members should be provided with options or alternatives as far as possible if they cannot afford the proposed fees and charges or choose not to pay for the relevant items. NGOs should lay down and publicise the fee waiver policy, including the pre-determined eligibility criteria and application procedures (if any).
- 8. Information containing all fees and charges should be clearly displayed in the service units concerned, including the channels for making enquiries or complaints.
- 9. An official receipt should be issued by the concerned NGO or service unit on receipt of payment of fees, bearing particulars of the item(s) paid andthe name of payee or service user. Records of payment must be kept by the NGO or service unit concerned which should be available for checking by government officials when necessary.

- (b) When making investments, NGOs must ensure adequate cash flow is maintained to cover daily operations, PF contributions for staff, and related expenses for Snapshot Staff, etc.
- (c) NGOs must disclose all interest earned from investing various reserves in Note 8 of the Annual Financial Report (AFR).

#### (2) Fixed Deposits/24-hour Call Deposits

To control investment risk, NGOs must adhere to the following guidelines regarding Hong Kong dollar bank deposits:

- (a) If the cumulative total deposit investments (the "**Total**") amount to \$100 million or more, the maximum amount that an NGO may deposit with any single bank<sup>1</sup> is limited to 20% of the "Total", requiring funds to be distributed across at least five banks; or
- (b) If the "Total" is below \$100 million (but exceeds \$800,000), the maximum amount that an NGO may deposit with any single bank is limited to 50% of the "Total", requiring funds to be distributed across at least two banks.

<sup>1</sup> The bank must be a licensed bank under the Banking Ordinance (Cap. 155).

- (c) However, if the "Total" is \$800,000 or less, the NGO may choose to place the entire deposit investment with a single bank.
- (d) Relevant examples are provided in **Appendix A**.

#### (3) Bonds and Certificates of Deposit

NGOs may also invest in short to medium-term Hong Kong dollar bonds, including government bonds or certificates of deposit (CDs), with a maturity period of one to five years. The related investment guidelines and conditions are as follows:

- (a) The cumulative total investment value of bonds/CDs must not exceed 50% of the NGO's overall reserve balance<sup>2</sup> at the time of investment.
- (b) If the cumulative total investment value of bonds/CDs is \$100 million or more, the maximum total value of Hong Kong dollar bonds and CDs that an NGO may invest with any single issuing institution is limited to 20% of the cumulative total investment value of bonds/CDs, requiring investments to be distributed across at least five issuing institutions; or
- (c) If the cumulative total investment value of bonds/CDs is under \$100 million, the maximum total value of Hong Kong dollar bonds and CDs that an NGO may invest with any single issuing institution is limited to 50% of the cumulative total investment value of bonds/CDs, requiring investments to be distributed across at least two issuing institutions<sup>3</sup> .

**23 |** SOCIALWELFARE SERVICES LUMP SUM GRANT SUBVENTION MANUAL

<sup>2</sup> The overall reserve balance includes LSG Reserve, PF Reserve and Holding Account Reserve.

<sup>3</sup> If the cumulative total value of bonds/CDs is under \$50 million, the NGO may choose to place all of its bond/CD investments with a single issuing institution.

- (d) The credit rating of the issuing institution must not be lower than **A3** as rated by Moody's Investors Service or **A-** as rated by Standard & Poor's Global Ratings.
- (e) Relevant examples are provided in **Appendix A**.

#### (4) Liquidity Constraints and Market Risks

(a) In addition to the aforementioned investment criteria and conditions, NGOs should also consider the following constraints and risks:

#### (i) Liquidity Constraints

NGOs should maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expenses related to the LSG Reserve, PF Reserve and Holding Account Reserve, including making any required refunds to the Government; fulfiling contractual and statutory PF contribution obligations for staff; and honouring contractual commitments to Snapshot Staff, etc.

#### (ii) Market Risks

NGOs should consider the risk of loss arising from changes in market interest rates, which can be further classified into fair value interest rate risk (i.e. the risk that the fair value of a bond/CD fluctuates because of changes in market interest rates) and cash flow interest rate risk (i.e. the risk that the future cash flow of a bond/CD fluctuates because of changes in market interest rates).

(b) When making investment, NGOs should pay special attention to liquidity constraints and market risks and make allowance for contingencies when projecting the use of various reserves.

#### (5) Income from Investments

- (a) NGOs may invest the LSG Reserve, PF Reserve and Holding Account Reserve either separately or collectively. All investment income must be fully and timely credited to Interest Received in Note 8 of the AFR, and become part of the overall reserve.
- (b) NGOs should make investment decisions prudently after careful consideration of the aforementioned risks. Any losses incurred from investments must be borne by the NGOs' own resources and cannot be covered by the LSG.

#### (6) Control of Investments

The governing board of an NGO should ensure that there are proper and effective internal control procedures by drawing up an investment operation manual for reference and compliance by all staff involved in investment operations, covering the following aspects:

- (a) clearly laid-down responsibilities and authorisation for decision making, transacting, recording and monitoring of investments;
- (b) ensuring that investments are made after careful financial planning to meet future uses of the LSG Reserve, PF Reserve and Holding Account Reserve, and to avoid undue loss from sale of investments prior to maturity;
- (c) obtaining quotations from multiple banks for bank deposit rates;
- (d) ensuring safe custody of investments with local licensed banks or their custodial subsidiaries;
- (e) conducting periodic reconciliation with the statements from banks and other parties concerned;
- (f) keeping proper accounting records for the transactions;
- (g) auditing regularly the investment operations with ongoing evaluation of management and operational controls to ensure that they are appropriate and effective to the level of investment operations; and
- (h) conducting regular reviews of investments and their returns.

<sup>1</sup> If an NGO uses its reserves for deposit investments with a cumulative total amount of \$100 million or more, no more than 20% of the total deposit investment amount should be placed in any single bank.

<sup>2</sup> If an NGO uses its reserves for deposit investments with a cumulative total amount of less than \$100 million, no more than 50% of the total deposit investment amount should be placed in any single bank.

Any surplus, which is not allowed to be offset by any deficit of another item, is subject to claw-back by SWD according to the terms and conditions of individual Central Items. Therefore, the income and expenditure of Central Items (including personal emoluments and other charges) should be charged to the respective Central Item account separately.

#### **NOTES ON THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT**

#### **1. Lump Sum Grant (LSG)**

- **a. Basis of preparation** The Annual Financial Report (AFR) is prepared in respect of all services defined in Funding and Service Agreement (FSA) (including support services to FSA services) funded by the Social Welfare Department (SWD) under the Lump Sum Grant Subvention System and also FSA services/ FSA-related activities funded by Other Funds or Donations for Designated Purposes. If NGOs receive specified funds or subsidy schemes from other government bureaux/departments to implement services/projects, they are not required to include these in the AFR and they are not required to apportion the costs of operating such services/projects, regardless of whether LSG resources are deployed or whether the services/projects provided are FSA services or FSArelated activities. Relevant specified funds or subsidy schemes from other government bureaux/departments are listed on [SWD's website.](https://www.swd.gov.hk/storage/asset/section/585/tc/List%20of%20specified%20funds%20or%20subsidy%20schemes%20exempt%20from%20cost-apportionment_as%20at%2024%20March%202025.pdf) AFR is prepared **on cash basis**, that is, income is recognised upon receipt of cash and expenditure is recognised when expenses are paid. **Non-cash items** such as depreciation, provisions and accruals **have not been included** in the AFR.
- **b. Lump Sum Grant (excluding Provident Fund)** This represents LSG (excluding Provident Fund) received for the year.
- **c. Provident Fund** This is Provident Fund received and contributed during the year. Snapshot Staff are defined as those staff occupying recognised or holding against subvented posts as at 1 April 2000. Other Posts represent those staff that are employed after 1 April 2000. The Provident Fund received and contributed for staff under the Central Items and Other Funds or Donations for Designated Purposes which are separately included as part of the income and expenditure of the relevant disclosures have been shown under **Notes 3 and 8**. Details are analysed below:

#### **Notes**:

- *only* **#** *Including an amount \$Z being the utilised allocation under CI: ASCP / Enhanced ASCP / ASCP(PC) – FWSS\**
- **\*** *For those programmes which are regarded as FSA services only*
- ^ *Balance generated from those completed FSA services/ FSA-related activities which are funded by Other Funds or Donations for Designated Purposes*

- (1) Interest received on LSG (including HA) and Provident Fund reserves, rent and rates, central items are included as one item under LSG; and the item is considered as part of LSG reserve.
- (2) Accumulated balance of LSG Surplus b/f from previous years (including all interest received in previous years (see (1) above), the balance of HA and balance of Other Funds or Donations for Designated Purposes should be separately reported.
- (3) Amount of LSG Reserve used to cover the salary adjustment for Infirmary Care Supplement, if any, as per Schedule for Central Items.
- (4) For NGOs without HA, separate disclosure of the movement of HA in their respective AFRs is not necessary. The level of LSG cumulative reserve (i.e. S1) will be capped at 25% of the NGO's operating expenditure (i.e. Total Expenditure (T1) excluding Provident Fund Contribution (K1)) for the year.

For NGOs with HA, with effect from 2022-23, the calculation of the annual claw-back is as follows:

(i) With Snapshot Staff (SS) [i.e. Position of SS as at 1 September being reported on the Agency Staff List submitted by NGO last year was greater than zero]

The level of LSG cumulative reserve (i.e. S1) will be capped at 25% of the NGO's operating expenditure (i.e. Total Expenditure (T1+T2) excluding Provident Fund Contribution (K1)) for the year.

(ii) Without SS [i.e. Position of SS as at 1 September being reported on the Agency Staff List submitted by NGO last year (which is regarded as Year 0) was zero]

For the next three years (Year 1 to Year 3), the level of LSG cumulative reserve (i.e. S1) will be capped at 25% of the NGO's operating expenditure (i.e. Total Expenditure (T1) excluding Provident Fund Contribution (K1)) for the year. From the fourth financial year (Year 4) onwards, the level of LSG cumulative reserve and HA reserve will be counted altogether and the combined reserve amount (i.e. S1+S2) will be capped at 25% of the NGO's operating expenditure (i.e. Total Expenditure (T1+T2) excluding Provident Fund Contribution (K1)) for the year. In this regard, separate disclosure of the movement of HA in their respective AFRs is not necessary.

[For details of (4)(i) and (4)(ii) above, please also refer to SWD's letter under reference (11) in SWD/S/109/1/10 of 4 April 2022.]

For any amount above the cap, SWD would arrange the claw-back (including provisional in the following financial year) accordingly

This framework is intended to provide some basic guidelines for non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) to conduct financial planning and projections. Other additional items may be included to suit the different operational needs of individual NGOs as appropriate. To facilitate reviewing and monitoring the annual financial position, NGOs may also consider listing out the breakdown of income and expenditure by items with reference to the format of Annual Financial Report (AFR) as supplementary information.

### **Revenue Collection and Receipt**

#### <span id="page-51-0"></span>**1.1 Segregation of Duties**

The duties of income collection (including preparation of officialreceipts) and accounts recording of income received (including preparation of receipt vouchers and posting of entries to general ledger) should be carried out by different officers. Should there be practical constraints which make segregation impossible, the NGO should ensure that there are proper reviews and reconciliation. Any abnormalities observed should be brought to the attention of the Management immediately.

#### **1.2 Official Receipts**

- (a) Official receipts should be:
	- (i) issued for all income received except for autopay;
	- (ii) in prescribed form;
	- (iii) serially numbered and issued in sequence; and
	- (iv) dated and issued to payer immediately upon receiving the income.
- (b) No amendment or alteration should be made on official receipts. If an error is made, the official receipt must be cancelled and retained in the Official Receipt Book.
- (c) Spoiled/ obsolete official receipts should be immediately and individually endorsed "cancelled". They should be retained in the Official Receipt Books. Destruction of them needs to be verified and witnessed by a senior independent officer not involved in daily operations.
- (d) An Official Receipt Book Register should be maintained to control the stock and issue of different types of official receipt books. The following procedures should be observed:
	- office receipt books; (i) The Official Receipt Book Custodian (the person responsible for keeping the Official Receipt Books not yet issued to the Official Receipt Issuing Officer) should sign and date the Official Receipt Book Register upon receipt of newlyprinted/purchased official receipt books;
	- (ii) Cashier authorised to receive money (the Official Receipt Issuing Officer) should be issued with only one Official Receipt Book for each type of receipt from the Official Receipt Book Custodian at a time, or if this isimpracticable,

the minimum number of books likely to be required for immediate use;

- (iii) The Official Receipt Issuing Officer should sign and date the Official Receipt Book Register when he/she is issued with a new Official Receipt Book by the Official Receipt Book Custodian; and
- (iv) The Official Receipt Book Custodian should sign the Official Receipt Book Register upon receipt of completed/obsolete Official Receipt Books from the Official Receipt Issuing Officer.
- (e) A suggested format of the Official Receipt Book Register is attached at **Appendix A**.
- (f) Unused or partly used Official Receipt Books should be kept under lock and key.

#### **1.3 Money Collected**

- (a) No post-dated cheques should be accepted except for donation.
- (b) Uncrossed cheques received should be immediately crossed in favour of the NGO, and made payable to "A/C Payee Only".
- (c) Money collected should be shown in gross as income in accounting records (i.e. without offsetting by expenses).
- (d) Money received should be banked promptly. Please see para. 2.1(a) of this **Annex**. (d) Money received should be banked promptly. Please see para. 1.1(a) of **Annex 5.10**.

#### **1.4 Daily Collection Summary**

- (a) The Daily Collection Summary should be prepared to record the daily collections. It should be immediately updated at the time when receipt is issued. This summary should contain the following information:
	- (i) date of receipt;
	- (ii) serial number of official receipt issued;
	- (iii) nature of income;
	- (iv) amount collected; and
	- (v) date of banking.

A suggested format of the Daily Collection Summary is attached at **Appendix B**.

(b) Supervisor of the service unit (the Checking Officer) should perform end of day checking to ensure that the cash/ cheque received, official receipts issued and records in Daily Collection Summary are matched.

### **Petty Cash**

#### <span id="page-66-0"></span>**1.1 Imprest System**

Imprest System is recommended to be implemented. Under this system:

- (a) The Petty Cash Holder is advanced a fixed float of money, he will use this petty cash on hand to pay claims of petty cash expenses.
- (b) When the amount of the float is almost used up, the Petty Cash Holder will apply for reimbursing the amount he has paid as supported by the invoices/claim forms, and should not use personal funds to cover any expenses.
- (c) The Petty Cash Holder should ensure that the amount of petty cash on hand is sufficient and avoid a negative balance in the petty cash book. The level of the petty cash float should also be reviewed periodically, if necessary.
- (d) At any point of time, the total amount of paid invoices kept by the Petty Cash Holder not yet claimed for reimbursement plus the cash on hand should always be equal to the amount of the fixed float.
- (e) The topping up of petty cash must be based on the actual shortfall below the fixed float threshold. The amount of petty cash held on hand by the Petty Cash Holder should never exceed the fixed float.
- (f) The fixed float threshold should be at a reasonable level to meet the requirement of petty cash expenses.

#### **1.2 Authorisation of Petty Cash Payment**

- (a) All petty cash payments should be properly authorised (i.e. the Authorising Officer should sign and date the petty cash invoices or claim forms) before they are eligible for petty cash claims.
- (b) The officer who authorises petty cash payment to individual claimants should not, at the same time, be the Petty Cash Holder or the Petty Cash Claimant.
- (c) The officer authorising the reimbursement of petty cash to petty

cash holder should not, at the same time, be the officer who authorises petty cash payment to individual claimants.

#### **1.3 Evidence on Receipt of Petty Cash**

- (a) The claimants should sign and date the invoices/ claim forms to give evidence of their receipt of the petty cash claims.
- (b) All invoices/ claim forms should be immediately stamped with a "PAID" chop upon settlement of the claims to prevent duplicate payments.

#### **1.4 Recording of Petty Cash Transactions**

- (a) A columnised Petty Cash Book with analysis of different types of expenditures should be maintained and regularly updated. A suggested format of the Petty Cash Book is at **Appendix A**.
- (b) Receipts other than reimbursements of petty cash must not be included in the Petty Cash Book.
- (c) Petty cash voucher number for each petty cash transaction should be properly maintained in the Petty Cash Book for cross reference.

#### **1.5 Details and Supporting Documents of Petty Cash Vouchers**

- (a) All petty cash payments should be supported by petty cash vouchers. Original invoices or claim forms with full details of the payment should be attached.
- (b) The petty cash vouchers should contain:
	- (i) serially assigned (preferably pre-printed) voucher number;
	- (ii) date of voucher;
	- (iii) ledger accounts to be entered;
	- (iv) description of the payment or full details of the goods and services provided;
	- (v) amount;
	- (vi) signatures and dates of Preparing Officer, Checking Officer and Authorising Officer. The voucher should be approved within one month; and
	- (vii) name of claimant and payee.
- (c) Major alterations on petty cash vouchers are prohibited but

minor alterations can be made by striking off. Use of correction fluid is not allowed. The alteration must be initialled/ signed by the officer certifying or authorising the petty cash voucher.

#### **1.6 Petty Cash on Hand and at Bank**

- (a) Bank account for holding petty cash should be held in the name of the NGO/ service unit instead of the petty cash holder who should only be one of the two authorised signatories.
- (b) All cash and evidence of payment, e.g. invoices, must be kept by the petty cash holder in lockable storage.
- (c) Unauthorised advance from the imprests for personal use of staff is disallowed.
- (d) Imprest money should be kept entirely separated from NGO's other money.

#### **1.7 Surprise Cash Count**

- (a) It should be conducted to detect and deter loss/ misappropriation of cash. The Checking Officer should sign and date to evidence that checking on the cash counted with Petty Cash Book and evidence of payment has been properly conducted. Should there be any discrepancies found, it should be recorded, reported to the Management and investigated.
- (b) It should be carried out by an officer other than the Petty Cash Holder (e.g. an independent officer from the headquarters or Supervisor of the service unit) at least 3 times a year at irregular intervals.

### **Accounting Records and Financial Reports**

#### <span id="page-82-0"></span>1.1 **Books of Accounts**

- (a) Books of accounts (including Cash Book, Petty Cash Book, Journal and General Ledger) should be maintained.
- (b) Use of suspense account for subvention moneys should be avoided as far as practicable. If a suspense account is deemed absolutely necessary, its balance must be cleared as soon as possible. Suspense account entries must be duly authorized by the governing board.
- (c) The following practices are useful in preparing and maintaining the books of accounts:
	- (i) correct opening balances should be brought forward with reference to the previous year's audited accounts. The ledger accounts should be balanced monthly;
	- (ii) income and expenses are properly recorded in gross amount and should not be offset (e.g. Production Income and Expenses of Sheltered Workshops or Integrated Vocational Training Centres);
	- (iii) expenses/ income should be allocated to the appropriate ledger accounts;
	- (iv) official receipt numbers, cheque numbers, voucher numbers, ledger account folios, etc. should be recorded in the books of accounts for easy cross-reference;
	- (v) all transactions must be supported by documentary evidence like signed and dated (manually or electronically) payment vouchers, petty cash vouchers, receipt vouchers, journal vouchers together with original source documents; and
	- (vi) mistakes/ errors in recording accounting entries should be crossed out with the book-keeper's initial instead of erasing or covering them with correction fluid. Where adjustments to the accounting entries are required, they should be made through duly authorized adjusting entries.

1.2 The governing board of an NGO should be involved in receiving the financial statements and the books of accounts at regular meetings. Special attention and explanation may need to be paid to:

- (a) remuneration of chief executives;
- (b) abnormal bank transactions;
- (c) abnormal assets/ liability items (e.g. large amount deposits, bank overdrafts, etc.);
- (d) negative balances in asset account (e.g. petty cash book and bank);
- (e) abnormal income and expenses;
- (f) personal spending (e.g. entertainment, overseas training and traveling);
- (g) loans of directors and employees, and inter-organisation borrowings; and
- (h) any other unusual items, etc.

#### <span id="page-83-0"></span>1.3 **Safe Custody of Records and Valuables**

Personnel records, accounting records and other valuables should be kept in a fire-proof and lockable cabinet; if available, in a safe. The cabinet key must be kept by the officer responsible for the safe custody of these records/ valuables.

#### **Guidelines for Procurement**

NGOs should set up procurement systems of their own in line with the following guidelines –

#### **1. Quotation and Tender Ceilings**

\* Unless it is specified by individual government departments (such as capital works projects of the Architectural Services Department), there is no minimum requirements on the number of returned tenders.

1.2 For procurement from public utilities including the Hong Kong Electric Company Limited, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited, Water Supplies Department, Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited, which are the sole suppliers for the relevant utility services in Hong Kong or the relevant regions of Hong Kong, NGOs are not required to call quotations/ tenders from the above-specified number of suppliers.

#### **2. Procurement Authority and its Delegation**

individual staff members at appropriate levels or quotation/ tender boards each 2.2 Subject to paragraph 2.3 below, the governing board of an NGO may itself 2.1 NGOs should establish internal requirements and procedures to exercise procurement aurhotriy and exceptional authority apppopriately. The governing board of an NGO may in writing delegate authority to individual staff members at appropriate levels or quotation panels/ tender boards each composing of not less than three persons including at least one senior staff member to conduct procurement and to approve inviting the appropriate number of quotations or tenders specified in paragraph 1.1 and accepting the lowest conforming quotation/tender offer or the conforming quotation/tender offer with the highest overall score (if a marking scheme is used). In general, the lowest conforming offer or the conforming quotation/tender offer with the highest overall score should be accepted unless the exceptional authority in paragraph 2.2 is invoked.

2.2 When conducting procurement, the governing board of an NGO can, at its own discretion:

- (a) approve (i) inviting quotations from fewer than the specified number of suppliers/contractors, or (ii) accepting quotations from fewer than the specified number of suppliers/contractors, or (iii) not accepting the lowest conforming quotation offer / the conforming quotation offer with the highest overall score (if a marking scheme is used) for procurement with a value not exceeding \$3,500,000 (applicable to works projects) or \$1,360,000 (applicable to services or stores); or
- (b) delegate authority in writing to individual staff members of appropriate levels or quotation panels/ tender boards to approve (i) inviting quotations from fewer than the specified number of suppliers/contractors, or (ii) accepting quotations from fewer than the specified number of suppliers/contractors, or (iii) not accepting the lowest conforming quotation offer / the conforming quotation offer with the highest overall score (if a marking scheme is used) for procurement with a value not exceeding \$1,750,000 (applicable to works projects) or \$680,000 (applicable to services or stores) in accordance with a set of terms and procedures prescribed by the NGO; or
- (c) approve soliciting tenders using selective tendering (paragraph 3.1.1 (b)) / single or restricted tendering with sufficient justification\*\*; or
- (d) not accepting the lowest conforming tender offer or the conforming tender offer with the highest overall score with sufficient justification and under highly exceptional circumstances\*\*@.

\*\* Unless it is specified by individual government departments (such as capital works projects of the Architectural Services Department).

@ Except for projects with funding from the Lotteries Fund.

2.3 The justifications for exercising the exceptional authority under paragraph 2.2 by the governing board or other persons authorised by the governing board must be properly documented on each occasion. For example, if a patented item is distributed through a sole agent, the governing board should provide the justifications for why that particular brand was chosen to support their exercise of the exceptional authority for a single quotation under paragraph 2.2. The supplier should also provide documentary proof to verify that they are the sole agent for the patented item.

2.4 In the exercise or delegation of the procurement authority, the governing board should ensure that –

- (a) the staff members or the quotation panels / tender boards responsible for procurement matters interpret the quotation/ tender limits strictly and that they do not evade the limits by dividing procurement requirements into instalments or by reducing the usual duration of contracts;
- (b) the reasons for inviting particular contractors or suppliers for quotations or tenders should be properly documented; and
- (c) for procurement conducted by individual staff members, the staff who invites the suppliers/ contractors for obtaining quotations should not be the same person to accept the offer for the purchase, as far as circumstances permit.

2.5 All records of invoking of exceptional authority should be properly maintained by each NGO. NGOs may be required to present such records for inspection upon request by SWD.

#### **3. Procurement Procedures**

MAMMANMANUAL

3.1 NGOs should consider adopting the following procurement procedures commensurate with the value of goods or services to be purchased –

3.1.1 Seeking tenders from suppliers/ contractors

There are three main ways of seeking tenders from suppliers/ contractors –

- (a) Open mode: All potential suppliers/ contractors are informed of the tender invitation via the NGO's website/ press, and other channels, allowing them to freely submit tenders.
- (b) Selective mode: Only suppliers/ contractors on pre-approved lists are informed of the procurement intentions and are allowed to bid on grounds of their qualifications and experiences. NGO should announce the tender invitation to all contractors/suppliers on the relevant approved lists through its website and/or invitation letters.

(c) Single or restricted: On grounds of urgency or security, for proprietary products or for reasons of compatibility, only one or a number of suppliers/ contractors approved by the governing board are invited to submit tenders.

#### 3.1.2 Drawing up requirements and specifications

NGOs should ensure that the features specified for the products or services are based on functional and performance requirements of the products or services and up to the international standard.

Requirements or specifications should not be modified to suit a particular brand or country of origin.

#### 3.1.3 Invitation for quotations or tenders

NGOs should ensure that the quotation invitation / tender document includes the following – NGOs should ensure that the quotation invitation / tender document

- (a) a broad description of the requirements and specifications; includes the following –(a)specifications;
- (b) estimated quantities and timing; (b)
- (c) the closing date and time for submitting quotations and tenders; (c)tenders;
- (d) the address for lodging quotations and tenders; (d)
- (e) where to obtain quotation/ tender documents which normally include standard contract forms\*\*; to obtain quotation/ tender documents which normally forms\*\*\*##;
- (f) probity clauses for bidders and contractors\*\*; and (f) probity clauses for bidders and contractors\*\*\*; and
- (g) the name of office or officer with a telephone number for enquiries. (g) the name of office or officer with a telephone number for enquiries.

\*\* For contractors (i.e. successful bidders), NGOs should include such probity requirements in the terms and conditions of the contracts / agreements. \*\*\* For contractors (i.e. successful bidders), NGOs should include such probity requirements in the terms and conditions of the contracts / agreements.

## The SWD encourages NGOs to include as far as practicable the mediation clause in the terms and conditions of the contracts / agreements. NGOs may obtain more information on the mediation clause in the website of [the Department of Justice.](https://www.doj.gov.hk/en/legal_dispute/mediation.html)

#### 3.1.4 Evaluation of tenders

The management of an NGO should be responsible for evaluating the tenders by making assessment, preferably without knowing the identity of the suppliers/ contractors, on an evaluation report with a standardised format as far as possible. The following factors may be taken into account for evaluation of tenders –

- (a) technical and financial capability of suppliers, and their relevant performance;
- (b) timely delivery or completion;
- (c) compatibility with existing or planned purchase;
- (d) after sale support and service including maintenance and spare parts provision, warranty and/or guarantees;
- (e) running and maintenance costs; and
- (f) fair market price, etc.

#### 3.1.5 Recommendations

After completing the evaluation of tenders, the tender board/ staff members authorised by the govering baord according to paragraph 2.1 may recommend the governing board to: –

- (a) accept a quotation/ tender at the lowest price, which fully complies with the conditions and specifications of the goods/ services; or
- (b) accept a quotation/ tender which attains the highest combined technical and price score, if there is/ are pre-determined factor(s) other than price.

#### 3.1.6 Approval of the quotations/ tenders

The award of contract(s) shall be approved by two authorised persons, whose authority of approval is delegated by the governing board. Procurement of a high value should be endorsed by the governing board according to the procurement policy of the NGO.

#### **4. Conflict of Interest**

MAMMANMANUAL

4.1 A conflict of interest is a situation in which the interest of the NGO competes or is in conflict with the financial or personal interests of the governing board or staff member, or their family members or close personal friends. A conflict of interest may be actual, potential or perceived.

<span id="page-88-0"></span>4.2 NGOs should remind and require its governing board or staff members involved in the procurement process to avoid any conflict of interest. If this is unavoidable, the governing board or staff members concerned should make the relevant declaration for a management decision as to whether they should abstain from the procurement exercise. NGOs should set up their own system for the declaration of interest in this regard.

### **Case Examples on Cost Apportionment** (For reference only)

#### **Residential Care Home for the Elderly**

 An NGO operates a residential care home for the elderly (RCHE) providing 150 (60%) subvented places (FSA services) and 100 (40%) self-financing places (non-FSA services) on the same set of premises with two respective care teams. There is a central kitchen with 7 cooks to prepare meals for all residents of the RCHE. A Clerical Officer (CO) spent 15% of his/her time in supervising these 7 cooks. Cost allocation is required on cost items which attribute to both subvented and self- financing places.

#### Cost Allocation Basis

CASE (C)

#### **Integrated Children and Youth Services Centre**

- An NGO runs a 100-hour programme for children under six in a subvented Integrated Children and Youth Services Centre (ICYSC). As this age group is not the target service users (aged 6-24) or affiliated family members of ICYSC, the NGO is required to allocate the costs in respect of PE, utility charges, R&R, etc. for these non-FSA services.

#### **Assessment Matrix Reference Guide for Service Quality Standards (Standards, Criteria, Assessment Indicators and Assessment Steps)**

#### *Explanatory Notes*

#### **1. Introduction**

This reference guide sets out the requirements of the 16 Service Quality Standards (SQSs) and their associated Criteria (stipulated as Assessment Indicators), as well as the Assessment Steps and Actions. Service units are required to implement the policies, procedures, mechanisms, plans, etc. accordingly. The guide will be used in the external assessments to determine whether the service unit meets the required level of service performance under the SQSs.

#### **2. Notes on Assessment Steps andActions**

The assessment may be conducted through interview with staff, interview with service users, observation, document review and other methods as appropriate as stated in the Assessment Steps and Actions.

#### *Interview with Staff / Service Users*

In addition to interviewing staff, there will be separate interviews with the management or service unit managers who may be required to give elaboration or clarification on policies and procedures and the implementation of the SQSs.

Service users stated in all criteria means service users and/or their family members and significant others according to service specific situations.

For the steps of interview, if implementation cannot be ascertained from interviewees, observation and review of implementation records may be used as supplementary information. Telephone contacts instead of interview may also be adopted.

#### *Review Document*

Document review will include the examination of documented policies and procedures asrequired and the written work generated from and proving the implementation of SQSs and criteria such as records, minutes of meetings and documents arising from the work process.

**Principle 1: Clearly Define the Purpose and Objectives of the Service and Make its Mode of Delivery Transparent to the Public**

**The purpose and objectives of the service should be clearly defined and its mode of operations transparent for the benefit of staff, existing and potential service users, and the general community.**

#### **Standard 1: Service Information**

*The service unit ensures that a clear description of its purpose, objectives and mode of service delivery is publicly available.*

#### **Remuneration Packages for Staff in the Top Three Tiers of Non-governmental Organisations operating Subvented Welfare Services**

#### **Self-assessment Report for the Reporting Year of 20XX-XX (Template)**

The Government has promulgated a set of guidelines concerning the effective control and monitoring of the structure, ranking and remuneration for the top three tiers executives in subvented bodies, and set out the arrangements for the public disclosure of such information. As stated in the Lump Sum Grant Subvention Manual, Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) receiving Government subvention are accountable for the use of public funds and are required to submit Selfassessment Report (SAR) on Remuneration Packages for Staff in the Top Three Tiers. For the avoidance of doubt, all NGOs are required to submit the SARs regardless of whether they are required to submit the Review Report on Remuneration Packages for Staff in the Top Three Tiers (Review Report).

*[Please read the explanatory notes before completing this form. The completed SAR should reach the Social Welfare Department (SWD) through the SPMIS by 31 October 20XX.]*

#### **Remuneration Packages for Staff in the Top Three Tiers of Non-governmental Organisations operating Subvented Welfare Services**

#### **Review Report for the Reporting Year of 20XX-XX (Template)**

According to the Lump Sum Grant Subvention Manual, Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) receiving recurrent subvention and subsidies from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) of not less than \$10 million a year and such amount exceeds 50% of their operating income pertaining to services / programmes within the welfare purview are required to submit the "Review Report on Remuneration Packages for Staff in the Top Three Tiers" (Review Report), and regularly review the number, rank and remuneration packages of their staff in the top three tiers. NGOs, currently exempt from the submission and disclosure of their Review Report, are encouraged to consider making public the remuneration information of such staff in order to enhance their public accountability and promote the public's understanding of NGOs' financial position.

In cases where the top three-tier positions of the NGO (or of a particular division, e.g. social service of the NGO, where appropriate) are funded entirely by the NGO's income from sources other than the SWD, other senior staff of the NGO (or of its particular division) occupying the subsequent three-tier positions may be covered subject to the NGO's particular circumstances such as its organisational structure.

[*Please read the explanatory notes before completing this form. The completed form should reach the SWD through the SPMIS by 31 October 20XX.*]

#### **Notes for Completing the Review Report on Remuneration Packages for Staff in the Top ThreeTiers of Non-governmental Organisations operating Subvented Welfare Services**

- (1) For Part (A), please input information of both serving and departed staff but exclude those staff serving their first contract, i.e. staff newly employed by the Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) in the reporting year. The information on staff newly employed by the NGO serving their first contract in the reporting year should be separately entered in Part (B) of the Review Report. For staff having internal promotion or transfer that brings about change in tier within the reporting year, please input the relevant remuneration information in the respective tier accordingly. For example, if a third-tier staff was promoted to a second-tier post with effect from 1 July 2022, the remuneration for the period from April to June 2022 should be reported under the third tier while the remuneration for the period from July 2022 to March 2023 should be reported under the second tier.
- (2) All monetary figures should be rounded up to the nearest dollar.
- The first-tier staff is generally defined as the executive head of the NGO who is directly responsible to the NGO Board / Management Committee, the second-tier staff as senior staff directly responsible to the executive head of the NGO, and the third-tier staff as senior staff directly responsible to the second-tier staff. Only staff members whose remunerations are partly or fully covered by SWD subventions should be included. (3) The first-tier staff is generally defined as the executive head of the NGO who is directly responsible to the NGO Board / Management Committee, the second-tier staff as senior staff directly responsible to the executive head of the NGO, and the third-tier staff as senior staff directly responsible to the second-tier staff. Only staff members whose remunerations are partly or fully covered by SWD subvention should be included.
- (4) Number of posts refers to post(s) occupied by remunerated staff during the reporting period. Post(s) without staff cost such as consultant on voluntary basis or vacant posts should not be counted where there is no expenditure on staff remunerations for the whole reporting year. Fractional posts should be indicated with figures up to two decimal places. Please note that number of post(s) may be different from number of head count. For example, if the number of staff turnover is twice for a post within the reporting year, the number of post(s) to be reported should be one instead of three.
- (5) Please list all post title(s) (e.g. Chief Executive Officer, Senior Social Work Officer). If there is one post in a tier reported in "(a) Number of Post" and the number of staff turnover is twice for the post within the reporting year (i.e. total three head count of staff), there should be one row of information added to "(b) Post Tittle" and the number of months is equal to total number of months served by the three staff. In another example, if there are three posts of Social Work Officer in the same tier, please input three rows of 'Social Work Officer', rather than input 'Social Work Officer x 3'
- (6) Please round up the number of month(s) to two decimal places (e.g. 0.50 or 0.33 month).
- "Total annual staff costs" refer to the total remuneration costs covering salary, provident fund, cash allowances and non-cash based benefits of all staff members of the tier incurred in the whole reporting year (i.e. from 1 April to 31 March in the reporting year). For staff working for both SWD subvented services and non-SWD subvented services, the portion of staff costs funded by non-SWD subventions should not be included. (7) "Total annual staff costs" refer to the total remuneration costs covering salary, provident cash allowances and non-cash based all staff tier the whole (i.e. from 1 April to 31 March in the reporting year). For staff working for both SWD subvented services and non-SWD subvented services, the portion of staff costs funded by non-SWD subvention should not be included.

- (8) Salary refers to the annual expenditure on annual salary of the respective staff for the whole reporting year.
- (9) Cash allowances such as responsibility allowance, housing allowance, hardship allowance, gratuity, overtime allowance, travelling expenses, etc. Please specify the type of allowance in bracket.
- (10) Non-cash based benefits include fringe benefits such as medical / dental insurance, staff quarters, transportation and / or chauffer, professional indemnity insurance, etc. Please specify the type of non-cash based benefits in bracket.
- (11) In evaluating the appropriateness of remuneration packages that have comparable civil service ranks, the SWD compares the average total cost of the remuneration for a tier of staff with that of civil servants at comparable ranks with reference to the annual average staff cost (including basic salaries, fringe benefits such as retirement benefits, contract gratuities, housing benefits, education allowance, medical and dental benefits, etc.) but not job-related allowances (e.g. overtime, acting, hardship and shift duty allowances) as indicated in the **Staff Cost Ready Reckoner** or the relevant recruitment benchmarks (currently **Recruitment Benchmarks**) compiled annually by the Government. In this Review Report, the annual average staff cost under SWD subvention is taken for comparison with that of civil service at comparable ranks of the social work officer grade in SWD. The comparable ranks are listed below -
	- Assistant Director of Social Welfare or above;
	- betweenAssistant Director of Social Welfare and Principal Social Work Officer;
	- between Principal Social Work Officer and Chief Social WorkOfficer;
	- between Chief Social Work Officer and Senior Social WorkOfficer;
	- between Senior Social Work Officer and Social WorkOfficer;
	- between Social Work Officer and Assistant Social Work Officer; or
	- Assistant Social Work Officer or below.

It should be noted that the above-mentioned comparable ranks are assessed based on the subvention received by the NGO from SWD which may constitute only part of the income of an NGO in a year.

- For Part (C), changes in remuneration amount may include significant upward / downward changes at 10% or more in total annual staff costs under SWD subventions as compared with the last reporting year, and / or changes in the remuneration components. (12) may include significant upward / downward changes at 10% or more in total annual staff costs under SWD subvention as compared with the last reporting year, and / or changes in the remunerationcomponents.
- (13) For public disclosure of the Review Report, only information in Part (A) to (C) will be disclosed.

# Glossary

#### <span id="page-165-0"></span>**Agreement Service Unit (ASU)**

An ASU refers to a unit operating welfare services governed by the concerned Funding and Service Agreements with subvention provided by the Social Welfare Department (SWD), which may or may not be premisestied. An NGO may operate more than one ASU on the same premises.

#### **Annual Financial Report (AFR)**

NGOs are required to prepare AFRs on cash accounting basis and submit to SWD annually in respect of all Funding and Service Agreements (FSA) services (including items for supporting FSA services) funded by SWD under the Lump Sum Grant Subvention System, and also FSA services / FSA-related activities funded by Other Funds or Donation for Designated Purposes (if applicable).

#### **Audited Financial Statements of the NGO as a whole**

An NGO is required to prepare audited financial statements of the NGO as a whole in respect of its operation on a yearly basis, which should be submitted to SWD together with the Annual Financial Report.

#### **Central Item**

Subvention for Central Items is allocated for specified purposes on a recurrent, timelimited or one-off basis which is not included in the Lump Sum Grant subvention allocation. Any surplus, which is not allowed to be offset by any deficit of another item, is subject to clawback by SWD according to the terms and conditions of individual central items.

#### 服務協議單位

服務協議單位指獲社會福利署(社 署)津助及在相關《津貼及服務協 議》規定下營辦的福利服務單 位, 而有關服務可受處所限制,亦可以 不受處所限制。機構可於 同 一處 所營運多於一個服務協議單位。

#### 周年財務報告

非政府機構必須就所有在整筆撥款津 助制度下獲津助,及有指定用途的其 他資金或捐款所資助(如適用 ) 並 受 《 津 貼 及 服 務 協 議》( 《 協 議》)規管的服務(包括支援《協 議》服務的項目),每年以現金會 計 方 式擬 備及 向社 署 提交周年財 務報告。

#### 整間機構經審計的財務報表

非政府機構必須就其營運狀況, 擬 備 整 間 機 構 經 審 計 的 財 務 報 表,並連同周年財務報告一併提 交社署。

中央項目為指明用途而提供的恆 常、有時限或一次性的資助撥款。 整筆撥款並不包括中央項目,社 署會按個別中央項目的條款收回 有關盈餘(如有),不得與其他項 目的虧損互相抵銷。

#### **Conventional Mode of Subvention**

Conventional mode of subvention refers to the old model that prevailed prior to the introduction of Lump Sum Grant Subvention System in 2001. It takes the form of Model System or Modified Standard Cost System under which NGOs must use the subvention allocations to settle expenditure for each item according to the recognised items as approved by SWD, with no virement of funds across those items.

#### **Cost Apportionment**

Cost apportionment refers to the apportionment of operating costs between subvented and non-subvented services of NGOs, so as to avoid cross-subsidisation.

#### **Cross-subsidisation**

To safeguard the use of public funds, NGOs must ensure that there is no cross- subsidisation of non-subvented activities by SWD-subvented programmes in money or in kind.

#### **Essential Service Requirement (ESR)**

The ESRs specify the necessary features of the infrastructure for a specific service such as the operating hours (e.g. 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays, 24-hour operation), essential staffing (e.g. nurses) and the requirement to comply with the relevant ordinances and / or regulations.

#### 傳統津助模式

傳統津助模式是在2001 年整筆撥款津 助模式推行前沿用的舊有資助模式。 此傳統津助模式採用模擬成本資助模 式或修訂標準成本資助模式。在此津 助模式下,非政府機構必須按社署核 准的認可項目支付每項開支,不得就 該些項目調配撥款。

#### 成本分攤

成本分攤是把用於非政府機構的津 助服務及非津助服務的營運成本予 以分攤,以避免越界補貼。

#### 越界補貼

為保障公帑用得其所,非政府機構 必須確保由社署津助的服務沒有在 金錢上或實物方面為非津助服務提 供補貼。

#### 基本服務規定

基本服務規定是因應個別服務而 指定的一些必要基本要求,如營 運時間(例如:星期一至五早上 八時至下午六時或24 小時運作)、 基本人員(例如:護士)以及遵從 相關條例及/或規例的要求。

#### **Funding and Service Agreement (FSA)**

A FSA is a binding document between SWD as a funder and an NGO as a service operator, which defines the purpose and objectives, service nature and contents, target service users, essential service requirements and performance standards on a specific type of service subvented by SWD.

#### **Funding and Service Agreement (FSA) related Activities**

FSA-related activities are services that are not specified in the FSAs but they are carried out by service operators with the same purpose and objectives, as well as same service nature covered by the FSA, while the service contents and target service users are in line with the FSA.

#### **Governing Board**

The governing body of an NGO may be referred to as "Board of Directors", "Management Board", "Executive Committee", "Council", etc. For the purposes of this Manual, the governing body of an NGO is collectively referred to as "the governing board".

#### 津貼及服務協議(《協議》)

《協議》是社署作為津貼提供者與 非政府機構作為服務營辦者所訂 立的具約束力文件,為社署津助 的指定服務類別界定服務目的及 目標、服務性質、服務內容、服 務對象、基本服務規定及服務表 現標準。

### 《津貼及服務協議》(《協議》) 相關活動

《協議》相關活動為《協議》內沒有 指明的活動,但由服務營辦者推行 符合《協議》的目的和目標,及服 務性質;並與《協議》有相關的服 務內容和服務對象的活動。

#### **Holding Account**

With the implementation of Lump Sum Grant (LSG) Subvention System in 2001, NGOs were provided with a one-off Tide-Over-Grants (TOG) from 2001-02 to 2005-06 in order to facilitate them to honour contractual commitments to Snapshot Staff. After the cessation of TOG in 2006-07, SWD withheld the claw-back of LSG Reserve above the 25% cap for three years from 2004-05 to 2006-07. NGOs may keep the cumulative LSG Reserves as at 31 March 2007 in the Holding Account to honour their contractual commitments towards the Snapshot Staff and enhance human resource arrangements. Starting from April 2025, NGOs may, after ensuring that sufficient funds are reserved to honour their contractual commitments to all Snapshot Staff, and with the agreement of the governing board and proper communication with staff through established mechanisms, use the remaining Holding Account Reserve in the same areas as LSG Reserve.

#### **Lump Sum Grant (LSG)**

Under the LSG Subvention System, recurrent subvention is allocated by SWD on an NGO basis with grants in a lump sum (therefore named as LSG) for operating subvented welfare services governed by the respective Funding and Service Agreements.

#### **Lump Sum Grant Independent Complaints Handling Committee (ICHC)**

The ICHC is composed of non-governmental independent members, which is responsible for handling Lump Sum Grant-related complaints that cannot be satisfactorily addressed at the NGO level.
